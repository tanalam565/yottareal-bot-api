  YottaReal Bot API - Frontend Entry Point
  ========================================

  This is the main HTML file for the YottaReal Property Management Chatbot frontend.
  It serves as the entry point for the React single-page application (SPA).

  - Theme color for mobile browsers
  - Root div where React mounts the application
  - Fallback message for users with JavaScript disabled

  Build Process:
  - This file is processed by webpack during the build
  - CSS and JS bundles are automatically injected
  - Meta tags can be customized in public/index.html
